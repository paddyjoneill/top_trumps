Group Project at Code Clan Edinburgh using Vue.js for the front end and express/MongoDB for the backend.

We selected the brief below:

Browser Game

Create a browser game based on an existing card or dice game. Model and test the game logic and then display it in the browser for a user to interact with.

Write your own MVP with some specific goals to be achieved based on the game you choose to model.

You might use persistence to keep track of the state of the game or track scores/wins. Other extended features will depend on the game you choose.

From there we decided to do Top Trumps (http://www.toptrumps.com/how-to-play-top-trumps/)

We managed to complete the MVP and extensions that we originally set out and ended up with a working game!

Since we finished the project I have personally added the project to Heroku (link above) and added a fourth Countries deck using the REST Countries API (https://restcountries.eu/).

There are still improvements to be made and I hope to work on these over time:
- Responsive CSS so works on a range of devices.
- Creating unique players whose data can be saved.
- Ability to load these players at the start of the game.
- Look into Vuex and Vue router.
- Refactor the playerOne and playerTwo Vues into one player Vue.
